This is a fork of http://liblogger.sourceforge.net/ project but enhanced for embedded systems. c-logger is a logging framework for C/C++, with the following features:
Transparent Logging to file/console/network.
Supports different logging levels.
Customizable : Log level, Module name, etc., can be configured on per file basis.
Zero Performance overhead when the logging is disabled.
Simple APIs similar to printf().
Log server in case of logging to socket.

Compilers : gcc, Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler.
Platforms : POSIX (Unix, GNU/Linux), Windows
The presence of a platform layer makes it very easy to port to new platforms.
